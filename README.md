## 📌 About This Repo

This repository is a **complete log of my Piscine journey** at [1337 Khouribga](https://www.1337.ma/en/) (part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)).  
It contains all my work from the famous **Pool (Piscine)**—an intensive 4-week coding bootcamp where every day is a new challenge.

## 🏊 Piscine Timeline

Each **C Project** represents a set of problems designed to push logical thinking, algorithms, and C programming skills.

- **C00 → C01**: Basic syntax, compilation, and the first baby steps in C  
- **C02 → C04**: String manipulation, conditions, loops, and modular thinking  
- **C05 → C07**: Recursion, advanced functions, pointers, and memory handling  
- **C08 → C09**: Structs, header files, and building larger programs  
- **C10 → C11**: File handling, advanced I/O, and modular libraries  
- **C12 → C13**: Advanced data structures, linked lists, and final Piscine challenges
