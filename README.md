   1337_POOL – My Journey Through the 42/1337 Piscine


# 1337_POOL – My Journey Through the 42/1337 Piscine

> **30 days of problem solving, debugging, and building real foundations in C.**  
> From **C00 → C13**, this repository reflects my growth, daily challenges, and solutions during the **1337 Khouribga Piscine**.



## About This Repository

This repository documents my complete journey through the Piscine at [1337 Khouribga](https://www.1337.ma/en/) (part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)).

It contains all my projects and solutions from the Piscine (Pool)—an intensive 4-week bootcamp designed to sharpen programming skills, problem-solving, and resilience.

**Content Creator**: I also share coding insights & Piscine tips on YouTube → [IkoSoftCompany](https://www.youtube.com/@IkoSoftCompany)



## Piscine Timeline

Each **C project** introduces a new layer of programming concepts, gradually building toward advanced problem-solving.

- **C00 – C01** → Syntax, compilation, and first steps in C  
- **C02 – C04** → Strings, conditions, loops, modular thinking  
- **C05 – C07** → Recursion, pointers, memory management  
- **C08 – C09** → Structs, headers, modular programs  
- **C10 – C11** → File handling, libraries, reusable components  
- **C12 – C13** → Linked lists, data structures, final challenges

## Vision

Completing the Piscine was not the end but the beginning of a journey.  
This repository is more than just code—it is a story of persistence:  

- Nights of debugging until 4 AM  
- Growing step by step through each project  
- Building resilience and adaptability  

**Next step** → Becoming a full 1337 student and pushing limits even further.
